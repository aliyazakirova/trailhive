Overview
TrailHive is a modern, responsive website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It features dynamic animations and a sleek design. The site collects user information through a modal and stores it in a Notion database.

Background
I started this project with a Figma file I found in the Figma community: SaaS, Nature Company â€” Webflow Landing Page Design. My goal was to recreate the desktop design pixel perfect to the existing design. Since the Figma file did not include tablet and mobile versions, I developed the adaptive versions myself. I also added animations to my taste and implemented a modal to collect user information, which is then sent to Notion.

Features
Next.js: Server-side rendering and static site generation.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Framer Motion: Powerful animations and transitions.
Notion: Store and manage user information collected from the modal.
